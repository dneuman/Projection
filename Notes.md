# Experiment Notes

## 2024-02-12

* Tried squaring ENSO (actually enso * enso.abs()) to get better matching on
peaks, but the overall variance reduction went from 19.7% to only 18.0%

* The Pacific Decadal Oscillation has no effect on the overall variance
reduction.

* MEI had a much worse fit than all the ENSO indices together

### Next:

* Move the axes onto one figure for easier posting.
